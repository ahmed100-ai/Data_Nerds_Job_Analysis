# Data Nerds Jobs Analysis ü§ì
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of **Data Analyst job market trends**, with a focus on the relationship between **technical skills, their demand in job postings, and their impact on salaries**.

The project was built entirely in **Excel**, utilizing **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation, and **Power Pivot** for advanced modeling, measures, and pivot-based reporting. The analysis is structured to highlight both technical proficiency and practical insights for career development.

## üìå Objectives

1. **Skill Demand Analysis** ‚Äì Identify which skills and tools (Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Oracle, etc.) are most commonly required in job postings.
2. **Salary Benchmarking** ‚Äì Compare salary distributions across regions (US vs Non-US).
3. **Skill-to-Salary Correlation** ‚Äì Quantify the effect of specific skills on median salaries.
4. **Data Modeling Practice** ‚Äì Apply Power Query and Power Pivot to create a structured, relational data model supporting flexible analysis.

## ‚ùì Research Questions

This project was guided by a set of business-driven questions, including:

**1. Which skills are most commonly required for Data Analyst roles?**  
**2. How do specific skills (Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Oracle, etc.) influence median salaries?**  
**3. What is the likelihood of each skill appearing in job postings?**  
**4. How do salaries compare between US and Non-US roles?**  
**5. What is the relationship between the number of skills required per job and the corresponding salary?**  
**6. Which skills provide the greatest balance between demand and salary advantage?**  

By answering these questions, the project connects raw data analysis to career planning and industry insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

- **Excel Power Query**
  - Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation (ETL process).
  - Standardized skill names, removed duplicates, and prepared data for modeling.

- **Excel Power Pivot**
  - Built relationships between multiple tables.
  - Created calculated fields, measures (e.g., median salary), and DAX formulas.
  - Designed pivot tables for dynamic analysis.

- **Data Visualization Tools**
  - Familiarity with Tableau and Power BI for extending insights into interactive dashboards.
 
## üìä Analysis & Key Findings

1. **Skill Demand**
      - SQL appears in over 50% of job postings, making it the most essential Data Analyst skill.
      - Tableau (28%) and Power BI (16%) show strong representation in the job market as visualization tools.
      - Python (27%) continues to grow in demand and is widely used in advanced analytics and automation.
      - Oracle (7%) is less frequent but still valuable in enterprise-level roles.
  
2. **Salary Insights**
      - Median Data Analyst Salary: $90,000
      - Regional Comparison: US vs Non-US salaries showed minimal differences in this dataset.

3. **Skill-Salary Relationship**
      - Python: Highest salary boost, with a median of ~$97,000.
      - Oracle: ~$96,900, despite lower demand.
      - Tableau & Power BI: Competitive range between $90,000‚Äì$92,000.
      - SQL: Consistently required, with median salary ~$90,000.

## üîÆ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis can translate raw information into actionable insights for both individuals and organizations. By leveraging Power Query for transformation and Power Pivot for advanced modeling, I was able to evaluate the demand, relevance, and salary impact of critical Data Analyst skills.

The findings emphasize that:
- SQL is the backbone skill every analyst must master.
- Python is the key differentiator for higher salaries and advanced roles.
- Visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI) remain essential for communicating insights effectively.
- Even niche tools like Oracle can provide strong competitive advantages in specialized positions.

Ultimately, this project highlights not just technical outcomes, but the strategic value of aligning skills with market trends. It reflects my ability to approach data with both a technical and a business mindset ‚Äî a core strength in the field of data analytics.
